# Arduino Uno Password System

This project implements a password system using an Arduino Uno board, a keypad, and an LCD display. The system prompts the user to enter a six-digit password and provides an optional password reset functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following components:

- Arduino Uno board
- Keypad
- LCD display
- Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- Required libraries (provide the names of any additional libraries used)

### Wiring

Please refer to the wiring diagram provided in the `docs` folder to properly connect the Arduino Uno board, keypad, and LCD display.

### Installing

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Arduino IDE.
